## Overview
___

In Fusion 360 there are a decent number of preset screw thread sizes, but when manufaturing parts to fit existing devices (i.e. threaded lens adapters for cameras, lens filter adapters, telescope part, etc.), chances are that the thread you need is not an existing preset within Fusion. You can create an XML file to define your own presets, however this is a relatively tedious process especially if you find yourself doing this often. In addition, whenever Fusion updates your custom presets won't be moved to the current install.

## Planned Feature Set
___

- Autmatically move user presets when Fusion updates
- Allow user to create metric screw threads by specifying thread diameter, pitch, and tolerance class
